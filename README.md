This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic Snake game using the turtle module. The game involves controlling a snake to eat food, which causes the snake to grow longer. The objective is to score as many points as possible by eating food while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own tail.

main.py: The main script that runs the game, initializes the screen, and handles the game loop.

snake.py: Contains the Snake class, which handles the snake's movement, growth, and collision detection.

food.py: Contains the Food class, which manages the food's appearance and random placement on the screen.

score.py: Contains the Scoreboard class, which manages the score display and tracks the high score.
